For smoother development, you can globally install the "nodemon" package by executing the command npm i nodemon -g. Once it's installed, you can initiate the application using npm run dev. This leverages "nodemon" to automatically restart the server whenever you're working on it. Alternatively, you can launch the application without "nodemon" using npm start


# ----npm install
# ----npm start 

Important: Remember to replace the placeholder key in the .env file with your own key. If you encounter an alert message, make sure that the key in your .env file is correctly configured.
